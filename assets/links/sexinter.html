  <h2>Sexual Consent</h2>
  <p>
    Consent means actively agreeing to be sexual with someone. Consent lets someone know that sex is wanted. Sexual activity without consent is rape or sexual assault.      
<br> <br> 
Consent is never implied by things like your past behavior, what you wear, or where you go. Sexual consent is always clearly communicated — there should be no question or mystery. Silence is not consent. And it’s not just important the first time you’re with someone.

    <br> <br>
    Sexual health plays an important role in physical and social well-being. Sexuality is a vital element of the human character. The World Health Organization (WHO) claims that positive sexual health not only influences a person’s physical and mental well-being but is also essential to achieving sustainable development and the realisation of global health and human rights .
