  <h2>All About Puberty</h2>
  <p>
    OK, so it's a funny word — but what is puberty, anyway?
Puberty (say: PYOO-ber-tee) is the name for the time when your body begins to develop and change as you move from kid to adult. We're talking about stuff like girls developing breasts and boys starting to look more like men. During puberty, your body will grow faster than at any other time in your life, except for when you were a baby.

  <h2>WHAT IS PUBERTY AND WHAT ARE HORMONES?</h2>
  <p>
    Puberty is a normal part of development that happens in the early teenage years. When you think of puberty, you might think of zits, body odor, and hair growth—among many other, sometimes awkward body changes—but do you know what happens in your body to cause these changes? The brain signals the body to start puberty by passing along messages in the form of hormonesSmall messengers that travel in the bloodstream to various parts of the body. Testosterone and estradiol are two hormones that are important for puberty..

  <h2>Precocious Puberty</h2>
  <p>
    Precocious puberty refers to the appearance of physical and hormonal signs of pubertal development at an earlier age than is considered normal. For many years, puberty was designated as precocious in girls younger than 8 years; however, studies have come to indicate that signs of early puberty (breasts and pubic hair) are often present in girls (particularly Black girls) between ages 6-8 years. For boys, onset of puberty before age 9 years is still considered precocious.</p>
